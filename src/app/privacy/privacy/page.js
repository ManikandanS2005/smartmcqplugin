      <p>
        Smart MCQ Plugin respects user privacy. This application uses Google
        Sign-In and the Gmail API only to send emails on behalf of the user when
        the user explicitly clicks the “Send Email” button.
      </p>

      <p>
        The app does not read, store, or delete any emails from the user’s Gmail
        account. No personal data or email content is stored on our servers.
      </p>

      <p>
        User information such as name and email address is used only for
        authentication and identification purposes.
      </p>
